ClickBot 
by Joseph Huynh

DESCRIPTION:
============
Bot for the Clickfast Flash game (http://www.andkon.com/arcade/mousegames/clickfast/).

HOW IT WORKS:
============
The bot continuously captures an image of the current screen and searches the image
for a pixel whose color matches a known RGB value.  If a match is found, it moves the 
mouse pointer to the corresponding location and performs a click action. Performance
was improved by increasing the pixel step size (ie. checking the color of every 15th
pixel instead of every pixel) and decreasing the search boundaries (only searching
within the flash game region and not the entire screen).

INSTRUCTIONS:
=============
1. Go to game web site (link provided), make sure browser window is maximized
2. Click 'Calibrate' to calibrate the bot to your screen size
3. Click 'Start' to run the bot
4. Start the game

TODO:
=====
- Reduce number of misclicks (tweak search and click algorithm?)
